    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Vivian, and I am a recently graduated 
      student looking for work. I have a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from UC 
      San Diego, and a minor in Computational Social Science. Here I have compiled 
      the projects I completed at each of my previous workplaces. Feel free to take 
      a look around!</p>
